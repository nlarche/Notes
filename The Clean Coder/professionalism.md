# Professionalism

### taking responsability

don't ship in production if you estimate you need more test. Even if you have a deadline!

### QA should find nothing

don't send code you're not certain about, but bugs will pass through

> Will QA find bugs ? Probably, so get ready to apologize -- and then figure out why those bugs managed to escape your notice and do something to prevent it from happening again (p12)

### 100 % test coverage

100 % is an asymptote

Design your code to be easy to test, so do your tests first, so do TDD

### Autmoted QA

### Change in your code must not cost

> You must be able to make change whitout exorbitant costs (p14)

refactor (micro, kindness, merciless refactor) all the time
don't be afraid youre code is tested
I 'm not afraid, I refactor all the time

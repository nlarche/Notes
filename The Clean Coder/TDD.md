# TDD
Shorten development cycle time

## The 3 laws of TDD

1. You're not allowed to write any production code until you write a failing test first
2. You're not allowed to write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail -- compiling is failing
3. You're not allowed to write more procution code than is sufficient to pass the current failing test

When programmers loose the fear of cleaning, they clean !

The unit tests are documents

Write tests first force thinking about good design

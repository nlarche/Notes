## [Exploring the state of reactivity patterns inÂ 2020](https://indepth.dev/posts/1280/exploring-the-state-of-reactivity-patterns-in-2020)

fined-grained reactivity => tracking reactive atoms and propagation of their change, wrapping executiuon in computed expressions

=> funcrional progaming  => const view = fn(state)
